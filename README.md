To run:
1.  Open the .ipybn file in jupyter notebook, not google collab.
2.  Run all the cells.
3.  Results should be a file called *test_predictions.csv*.

Running the notebook should create all the necessary files and folders. For organization's sake, it is recommended to place the .ipybn file in a folder all of its own.
